# README

PhotoGo is a sample application I wrote in 2020 for an interview, and updated from Rails 6 to 7 in 2024.

## What does it do?
PhotoGo is a simple photo upload app, similar to Instagram in function.
Users can create accounts, upload photos, add them to albums, and comment on both their and other people's photos.

## Plans
Use the photo descriptions as prompts, and just post an AI-generated image, with no prompt. Leave image for interpretation in comments.
(As of June 2024, I'm tired of giving away AI compute as a business model, so that's not happening haha.)
